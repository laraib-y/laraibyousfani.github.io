            <h3>About Me:</h3>
            <p>Hi! My name is Laraib Yousfani, and I am a second year computer<br>science student at SFU. When I'm not studying,
                I'm working at<br>one of my two jobs, spending time with my family, reading books (specifically fantasy),<br>or playing games online with my friends.
                As for games, I love puzzle-themed<br>games, such as escape rooms, or FPS games such as Valorant. I am<br>also a huge fan of cats
                and have been begging my parents for one for the past<br>10 years (still no success).

            <h3>Projects:</h3>
            <p>
                I'm currently working on a project for my CMPT 365 class where I've used Python to develop<br>
                a GUI that lets users open a BMP file and view both its metadata and the image.The metadata<br>
                is extracted using a custom BMP parser I've created.<br><br>
                In addition, I've implemented features like a brightness adjustment tool, an image resizing<br>
                option, and RGB toggles to selectively remove RGB channels from the image. More features for<br>
                this project will be implemented throughout the semester!
